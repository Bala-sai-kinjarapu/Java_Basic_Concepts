// Exception handling :
// we can handle checked exceptions but not un checked exceptions.
// we will do it by using // try,catch,finally blocks;
// in try block we sill write the code that will throw an error;
//..int ccatch block we will catch the exception that is thrown in the try block.
//.. finally block will be execuited even the exception is thrown or nt thrown.
// one try block can have meny catch blocks.
// the key word is Exception , throw , throws
